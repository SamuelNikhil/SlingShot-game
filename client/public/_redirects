# Render/Netlify Redirects Configuration
# =======================================
# This file handles SPA routing and optional proxy fallback for WebRTC signaling.
#
# HOW IT WORKS:
# - The first rule proxies signaling to your game server (only if VITE_USE_PROXY=true)
# - The second rule enables SPA routing (all requests -> index.html)
#
# TO USE PROXY MODE:
# 1. Uncomment the proxy rule below
# 2. Replace YOUR_GAME_SERVER_URL with your actual game server URL
# 3. Set VITE_USE_PROXY=true in your environment

# Proxy signaling to game server (uncomment if using proxy mode)
# /.wrtc/*  https://YOUR_GAME_SERVER_URL:3000/.wrtc/:splat  200

# SPA fallback (required for React Router)
/*  /index.html  200
